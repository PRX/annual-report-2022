<p>In 2003, PRX was created to address a particular challenge of the time—great stories were produced for radio, aired once, and then disappeared. PRX solved this problem by creating the first open, searchable, digital marketplace devoted to audio—The PRX Exchange. We also built an economy to support it.</p>

<p>Our aims were to reduce the friction that stifled opportunities for independent producers and to expand the shelf life of evergreen stories. Prior to this, public radio stations had only two content choices to either air national programs or to make content themselves. PRX created a middle option giving independent producers local and national broadcast reach, and public radio stations the access to choice. In doing so, we unlocked opportunities for diverse voices and opened an otherwise closed system. PRX also became one of the first places you could listen to public radio on the internet.</p>

</p>In those early days, PRX had a rebel vibe. We disrupted the status quo to create something new, efficient, and more accessible. Today that nonconformity has led to expansive impact. We see our work as a catalyst for change—turning problems into opportunities, reframing difficulties, and empowering people and teams to expand the story of public media.</p>
