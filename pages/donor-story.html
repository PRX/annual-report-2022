<p>&ldquo;I tell people that I turned on public radio and never turned it off. What I found was a wealth of information, knowledge, music, and entertainment coming to me from one place on my radio dial. I was so excited to contribute to my first fundraising campaign! I got a bumper sticker which I proudly displayed on my 1978 Honda Accord.</p>
<p>How I missed public radio when I moved to a small town in Italy. The first Gulf War started and Radio Free Europe was the only English language broadcast. CNN was new, and its television reports were overdubbed in Italian. I couldn’t even get an English language newspaper on a daily basis. Later, I lived in Hong Kong and visited as many countries in Asia as I could. Google was brand new then, but it was still hard to get the news I craved from home and other parts of the world.</p>
<p>When I moved back to the US I turned on my radio and found <a href="https://theworld.org" target="_blank"><span><em>The World</em><span></a>. How refreshing to hear about the countries where I’d lived! No other news source follows international news like <em>The World</em>. Once you’ve lived extensively in other countries, your understanding and interest in global news is forever altered and heightened. PRX is also the home of some of my favorite shows: <a href="https://themoth.org" target="_blank"><span><em>The Moth Radio Hour</em><span></a>, <a href="https://thisamericanlife.org" target="_blank"><span><em>This American Life</em><span></a>, <a href="https://revealnews.org" target="_blank"><span><em>Reveal</em></span></a>, <a href="https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/ted-talks/ted-talks-audio" target="_blank"><span><em>TED Talks Daily</em></span></a>.</p>
<p>Following the evolution of PRX as a provider of broadcast programs as well as a myriad of excellent podcasts has enriched my life. I can say without a doubt that attending <a href="https://www.prx.org/ambassador-council" target="_blank"><span>PRX Ambassador Council</span></a> events has always been a highlight of my year. Scintillating, engaging, and thought-provoking. I always come away with insights, new ideas, and a deeper understanding of the issues we face today.</p>
<p>And I know I will keep listening to the PRX podcast portfolio. Podcasts are the great new thing, afterall, but you will pry my public radio from my cold dead hands.&rdquo;</p>
