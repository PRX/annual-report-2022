<p>Our Content Development (formerly Training) team headed to Nairobi for the inaugural <a href="https://africamediafestival.com/"><span>Africa Media Festival</span></a> in February, hosted by <a href="https://barazalab.com/"><span>Baraza Media Lab</span></a>. PRX held a Podcasting Hackathon with more than 40 media and technology professionals from across East Africa, where participants ideated and prototyped solutions to challenges facing podcasting, audio distribution, and accessibility in a regional context.</p>
<p>On the sidelines of the festival, PRX hosted a <a href="https://medium.com/prxofficial/prx-to-host-pop-up-podcast-garage-experience-in-nairobi-kenya-c4bf14bf3950"><span>Pop-up Podcast Garage</span></a> at Baraza, where attendees participated in live workshops from PRX and our partners, including Hana Baba and Leila Day — the producers behind Radiotopia’s <em><a href="https://www.thestoop.org/"><span>The Stoop</span></a></em> — and Johannesburg-based journalism and audio non-profit <a href="https://childrensradiofoundation.org/"><span>Radio Workshop</span></a>. The workshops covered topics, including audience-first podcast design, storytelling, and interview skills. In the evenings, PRX hosted live podcast tapings, panel discussions, and networking sessions for audio-makers.</p>
<p>PRX is growing our international network. Our community partnership with Baraza Media Lab was sparked in 2022, when the PRX Training team facilitated the <a href="https://medium.com/prxofficial/prx-announces-africa-podcast-lab-podcast-development-training-program-for-journalists-6d21780c87ac"><span>Africa Podcast Lab</span></a>, a podcast development training program for health journalists, producers, and storytellers in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. This year in Nairobi, we built on existing and new relationships, listening and learning about nuances in the African media space and how we might support growing audio ecosystems. </p>
