<p>With major support from the John Templeton Foundation, PRX launched the <a href="https://www.prx.org/bigquestions"><span>Big Questions Project</span></a> — a program supporting the development of four new podcasts centered on issues of spirituality, character, ethics and humility. The shows explore faith from the perspective of those who have been historically minimized, the billion-dollar Christian music industry, the moral impact of technological advancements, and the complexity of motherhood — all with the support of PRX Productions, Content Development, Distribution and Marketing.</p>
