quote: "&quot;In our reports we try to take listeners to the center of the story, where events are unfolding. I’ve reported from the Russia-Ukraine border just weeks before Russia’s full-scale invasion. I visited a village near Bucha in the outskirts of Kyiv, where people were rebuilding their lives some months after Russian occupation. Nothing can simulate the sound of priests singing the Christmas liturgy in Ukrainian inside the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. Or the experience of entering a Ukrainian prison, where Russian POWs are being held and questioned about war crimes. This kind of reporting, which informs the public about perhaps the most important story of our time, is impossible to deliver without proper resources.&quot;"

donor-quote: "&quot;I have been listening to your program for over a decade and deeply admire the way you both shed light on the background behind the big news events of the day and share local stories from around the planet that escape the notice of other America-based news outlets. There is no other daily news program that I can listen to weeks or even months later and still be both engaged and informed because of the depth, breadth, and detail of the coverage. Thank you for your immensely humane, tirelessly inquisitive work in bringing global news to a global audience.&quot;"
