quote: "<p>&ldquo;In our reports we try to take listeners to the center of the story, where events are unfolding. I&apos;ve reported from the Russia-Ukraine border just weeks before Russia&apos;s full-scale invasion. I visited a village near Bucha in the outskirts of Kyiv, where people were rebuilding their lives some months after Russian occupation.</p><p>This kind of reporting, which informs the public about perhaps the most important story of our time, is impossible to deliver without proper resources.&rdquo;</p>"

<p>This year, some of <em>The World's</em> top stories focused on the far-reaching impacts of the war in <a href="https://theworld.org/categories/ukraine" target="_blank">Ukraine</a> and the hunt for <a href="https://theworld.org/categories/big-fix" target="_blank">solutions to living</a> on an ever-warming planet. Our journalists explained how migration policies create challenges to accessing <a href="https://theworld.org/categories/worlds-global-classroom" target="_blank">education</a>, and explored the intersection of <a href="https://theworld.org/categories/sacred-nation" target="_blank">religion and nationalism</a> in countries around the globe. From vast disruption to burgeoning resilience, <em>The World</em> captures the stories of the people living the news.</p>
