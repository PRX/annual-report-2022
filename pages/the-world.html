quote: "<p>&ldquo;...I visited a village near Bucha in the outskirts of Kyiv, where people were rebuilding their lives some months after Russian occupation. Nothing can simulate the sound of priests singing the Christmas liturgy in Ukrainian inside the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. Or the experience of entering a Ukrainian prison, where Russian POWs are being held and questioned about war crimes.</p><p>This kind of reporting, which informs the public about perhaps the most important story of our time, is impossible to deliver without proper resources.&rdquo;</p>"
