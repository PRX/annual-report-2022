<p>Co-creators and hosts Nigel Poor and Earlonne Woods headed to Norway to attend the first International Prison Radio Conference and to learn how the country's “prison utopia” compares to experiences in California. In March, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced plans to turn San Quentin State Prison — the facility at the center of the podcast — into a Norwegian-inspired rehabilitation center.</p><p>Closer to home, Ear Hustle began a partnership with the California Institution for Women, incorporating the voices and unique experiences of incarcerated women into recent and upcoming seasons. Ear Hustle also celebrated the release of co-host Rahsaan “New York” Thomas, who began serving as co-host from inside San Quentin State Prison in 2019. Thomas received clemency from Gov. Newsom and was paroled in February, continuing his work on the pod from the outside.</p>
