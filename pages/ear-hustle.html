<p>Co-creators and hosts Nigel Poor and Earlonne Woods <a href="https://medium.com/prxofficial/ear-hustle-from-radiotopia-releases-first-episode-with-stories-from-an-international-prison-c798e682ad2e"><span>headed to Norway</span></a> in June to attend the first International Prison Radio Conference and to learn how the country's “prison utopia” compares to experiences in California. In March, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced plans to turn San Quentin — the facility at the center of the podcast — into a Norwegian-inspired rehabilitation center.
Closer to home, <em>Ear Hustle</em> began a partnership with the California Institution for Women, incorporating the voices and unique experiences of incarcerated women into recent and upcoming seasons. <em>Ear Hustle</em> also <a href="https://www.earhustlesq.com/episodes/2023/2/22/welcome-home-new-york"><span>celebrated the release</span></a> of Rahsaan “New York” Thomas, who began serving as co-host from inside San Quentin State Prison in 2019. Thomas received clemency from Gov. Newsom and was paroled in February, continuing his work on the show from the outside.</p>
