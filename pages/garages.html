<p>In Boston, with major support from the Barr Foundation, we worked with partners in the local community to develop the <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAFlJSorL0c/Qa-p6ymxI-IEITf31Fccxw/edit"><span>Massachusetts Storytelling Collaborative</span></a> — an initiative that centers storytelling as a tool for community change and problem-solving. Focused on the intersection of community engagement and audio storytelling, the collaborative brings together organizations to share key priorities, influential contacts, and provide needed resources to build networks strengthening the creative economy in greater Massachusetts.</p>"
page-content2: "<p>As live venues rebounded this year, we worked on reimagining what in-person activities look like for the Podcast Garages. As part of the Massachusetts Storytelling Collaborative, PRX hosted <a href="https://www.podcastgarage.org/events/https/wwweventbritecom/e/the-cookout-tickets-643260979907"><span>The Cookout</span></a>, a live storytelling event with Aeronaut Allston. In December and April, the makers of “<a href="https://www.ttbook.org/series/going-for-broke"><span>Going for Broke</span></a>,” a special series from PRX's <em><a href="https://www.ttbook.org/"><span>To the Best of Our Knowledge</span></a></em> and the Economic Hardship Reporting Project, connected with listeners for a panel discussion in Boston and at KQED. In May, Hana Baba and Leila Day of <em><a href="https://thestoop.org"><span>The Stoop</span></a></em> podcast met with Glynn Washington of <em><a href="https://snapjudgment.org/"><span>Snap Judgment</span></a></em> for a live taping on topics ranging from their journeys navigating the podcasting and media industries, to what it means to tell Black stories today. At our Maker Mingle workshop, we explored scoring for the iconic <em><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/"><span>This American Life</span></a></em>.
<p>As studios, training facilities, and event spaces, the Garages are expanding capacity to help new creators break into audio — whether that be prepping new storytellers for a debut with <em><a href="https://themoth.org/"><span>The Moth</span></a></em> or getting their stories aired on KQED. On both coasts, the PRX Podcast Garages hold space to connect, learn and grow in audio.</p>
