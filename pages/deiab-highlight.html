quote: "<p>&ldquo;Equity work, at its heart, is a series of choices every day — how we show up, connect with each other, and speak with each other. The conversations we elevate and voices we engage with. We make choices by the minute. My hope is to provide more knowledge around how we make decisions and choose our adventure.&rdquo;</p>"

<p>We are engaging in education, celebration and creating inclusive spaces within our own organization and beyond — from small actions like book clubs and discussion series, to actively centering local communities in our Podcast Garage work, to collaborating with partners to make bigger impacts in the public media space.</p>
<p>This year, working with Oregon Public Broadcasting and Greater Public, PRX convened a <a href="https://greaterpublic.org/resources/equity-inclusion/diversity-equity-inclusion-accessibility-and-belonging-deiab-cohort/" target="_blank"><span>cohort of IDEA professionals</span></a> across the public media system to provide a space to convene and share resources. PRX also teamed up with Public Media for All for a day of education in support of equity in public media. We built out IDEA training and consultancy — working with shows like <em>Live Wire</em>, <em>Snap Judgment</em> and <em>The World</em> to track how we bring a diversity of stories to air.</p>
