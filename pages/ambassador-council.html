quote: "<p>&ldquo;I loved being at the Ambassador Council event. We are moved by what PRX does. Both of my friends were blown away. I found the programs inspiring. The food was amazing. You feel good to be a part of a community again after being isolated for so long. I wouldn't know what to do without public radio. I am fascinated by what PRX has done and hope we can support it in years to come. THANK YOU for welcoming us all.&rdquo;</p>"

Over the past year, we gathered at Blue Rock Artist Ranch and Studio in Wimberley, Texas — the striking home of board member Dodee Crockett and her husband, Billy — for an intimate evening of storytelling and music with Hrishikesh Hirway, host and creator of <a href='https://www.radiotopia.fm/podcasts/song-exploder'target='_blank'><em>Song Exploder</em></a> from Radiotopia, and Sam Beam of Iron & Wine. A few months later we connected at the annual PRX Ambassador Council event in San Francisco, where we journeyed through the world of PRX. We also came together this year in Dallas, New York, and Seattle, among other places, for events featuring talent from across the diverse PRX portfolio.</p><p>To join or learn more about the Ambassador Council visit <a href='https://www.prx.org/ambassador-council' target='_blank'><span>prx.org/ambassador-council</span></a>.</p>"
