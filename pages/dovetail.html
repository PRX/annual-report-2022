This approach not only empowers creators but also reduces the workload on PRX's ad operations team. And the entire suite of Dovetail applications is available to users without any paywalls, aligning with PRX's mission of openness and empowerment.</p><p>We're actively building a product and support system that serves stations' needs. Rather than being cornered into working with commercial entities that may have conflicting values, PRX provides podcasters a mission-aligned choice that is also easier on public media budgets. Dovetail is also used by numerous independent producers and mission-driven organizations.</p>"

<p>With new advancements for <a href="https://dovetail.prx.org/" target="_blank"><span>Dovetail</span></a> — our suite of applications optimizing and streamlining the post production process for podcasts — PRX is giving public media stations across the country more control over their content.</p>
<p>When North Carolina's public radio station WUNC became the first self-serve client on Dovetail last year, they gained the ability to organize podcast feed management, ad trafficking, and download metrics with one service. This move allowed them to unify their operations, modernize their setup and expand. Since adopting Dovetail, WUNC has added three new shows to their portfolio.</p>
