audio-quote: "&ldquo;... I think what you do with this program is amazing and I really appreciate the effort. And I don't know if you hear it enough or if it's communicated properly enough to you, but the two of you [Stephanie Kuo and Mike Russo, PRX Content Development] do something very special and you help give people the tools to have a stronger voice. So thank you for that …&rdquo;"

quote: "<p>&ldquo;Just last summer, we didn't think we were capable of creating a podcast at all, let alone a podcast as ambitious as <em><a href='https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/ourhawaii' target='_blank'><span>This is Our Hawai&apos;i</span></a></em>… But we're all incredibly proud to be working on something of substance, something that gets at what it means to live here and the complicated equation of belonging that makes life in Hawai&apos;i so rich and so excruciating. Without PRX, and without your diligent, grounded expertise, we never would have had the skills or language to translate our ideas into a real, tangible product.</p><p>PRX has given [us] the building blocks for a team that can make something great. Thank you so much for being in our corner the whole way through.&rdquo;</p>"

content2: "<p>PRX Content Development also built out consultancy efforts, supporting local news organizations, universities and public institutions in their efforts to design production processes, audit existing products, market their work, and engage staff in new creation methodologies. The team helps local and regional outlets “future-proof” their organizations with audio-on-demand and authentic audience-first growth. PRX aims to create meaningful impact across public media and podcasting as catalysts for radical change from the bottom up — helping creators approach and make better media for real people.</p>"

<p>This year, we chose evolution, parlaying years of experience working with creators on the ground into a design and development wing now known as Content Development. We continue to focus on helping public media, journalism and storytelling institutions build sustainable infrastructure for podcast and media innovation.</p>
<p>We helped stations move from podcasting 1.0 to podcasting 2.0 through the <a href="https://medium.com/prxofficial/prx-welcomes-eight-media-organizations-to-the-prx-journalism-podcast-accelerator-e10c6d9626c9"><span>PRX Journalism Podcast Accelerator</span></a>, launched with support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Through the JPA, our team provided mentorship, enduring support, and podcast training to journalists in three 12-week training sessions across three regional cohorts.</p>
